      <p>This project was developed for Qualcomm, source code cannot be shared</p>
<p>Vulcan is Bare-Metal OctaCore platform to run Thermal Mitigation Algorithms. The team I work for works without any an OS( Android ) in most of the cases, the motivation behind this project was to evaluate the hardware without any other system imposed on top of it.</p>

<p>The features provided are :</p>

<pre><code>Multi-Core Hotplugging
DCVS per Cluster
RealTime Visualization
High Frequency Logging 
xml based Throttling Algorithm syntax and parsing
Offline comparative analysis of Algorithms
Multi-Sensor StateMachines for Throttling Algorithms
QBlizzard is the only benchmark supported 
Virtual corners support     
</code></pre>

<h3>Demonstration : </h3>

<p>Thermal mitigation algorithms can influence the system either by taking cores offline or by cutting down on the Voltage/Frequency of the systems' operation. This demonstration tries to showcase the effect of manipulating these knobs on the systems' overall temperature. </p>

<p>The temperature profile was captured in real time from the chip on which the algorithm was being exercised </p>

<p>Details on the representation above :</p>

<p>Cores in Green are online, while the ones in Grey are offline and the one in Red is the Master Core which handles this system. </p>

<p>Green Dashed Line : is representative of the number of cores online at any given point in time</p>

<p>Red Line : is the Temperature of this system in *C </p>

<p>Blue Dashed Line : is the representative of the instant when Frequency of the system was changed </p>
